        <h1>Privacy Policy for Pocket Travel Planner</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 02/16/2025</p>
    
        <p>Mitch Smith ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Pocket Travel Planner app (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use the App.</p>
    
        <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect information necessary to provide and improve the App’s features. The types of information we may collect include:</p>
    
        <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not require or collect personal information, such as your name or email address, unless you choose to provide it through optional features, like feedback forms or support inquiries.</p>
    
        <h3>b. Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect non-personal information automatically, including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (such as model, operating system version)</li>
            <li>Usage data (such as the features you use, interactions with the App, and performance data)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We may use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve the App’s performance and functionality</li>
            <li>Provide customer support</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage to improve the App</li>
            <li>Send optional notifications about your trips and reminders</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize your data security and take reasonable measures to protect it. We do not store or share your personal data on external servers. All data related to your trips and plans is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.</p>
    
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not use third-party analytics services or advertising platforms that track or collect personal information from your use of the App. However, we may offer third-party integrations (such as calendar or maps) for your convenience. These services may have their own privacy policies governing your data.</p>
    
        <h2>5. Notifications and Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may ask for access to certain device features such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send trip reminders or important updates. You can manage notification preferences within the app settings or your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Access:</strong> If you choose to add your trip details to your device’s calendar, we request permission to do so.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We only request access to these features when you initiate their use. You can always deny or revoke permission via your device settings.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete it.</p>
    
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and become effective as of the "Effective Date" stated above. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any updates.</p>
    
        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
