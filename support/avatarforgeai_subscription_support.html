    <section>
      <h2>1. Quick fixes (try these first)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure you're online (Wi-Fi or cellular) and the App Store works for other apps</li>
        <li>Open the app > Store tab > tap "Restore Purchases" and wait 10â€“20 seconds</li>
        <li>Make sure you are signed into the correct Apple ID on this device (Settings > [your name])</li>
        <li>Force-quit the app and reopen it; if needed, restart your iPhone</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. "Subscription linked to another account" message</h2>
      <h3>What it means</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your subscription is active on this device's Apple ID but is already linked to a different AvatarForge AI account (email) in our system. Each subscription can only be attached to one app account at a time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to fix</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you own the subscription under a different app account: Sign Out in the app, then Sign In with the account that originally subscribed</li>
        <li>If you want to move the subscription to a new app account: Cancel the current subscription in the App Store, wait until it expires, then subscribe again from the desired account in the app</li>
        <li>You can also manage your subscription directly: App Store > Account > Subscriptions > AvatarForge AI</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Restore Purchases isn't restoring my subscription</h2>
      <h3>Checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm the Apple ID: The Apple ID on your device must match the one that purchased the subscription</li>
        <li>Tap "Restore Purchases" in the app Store tab and wait (don't close the app during restore)</li>
        <li>If you installed via TestFlight previously, install the App Store build and sign in again (TestFlight and App Store entitlements are separate)</li>
        <li>If you recently changed Apple ID regions or payment method, re-open the App Store app, then try restore again</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Which app account owns my subscription?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The subscription is linked to the first AvatarForge AI account that successfully synced after purchase</li>
        <li>For privacy and security, we cannot disclose another user's identity</li>
        <li>If you have multiple emails, try signing in with each one and tap "Restore Purchases" to find the linked account</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Find your Apple Subscription/Transaction details</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Mail and search for "Apple Receipt" for the AvatarForge AI subscription</li>
        <li>Or go to: App Store > Account (top-right) > Your Account > Purchase History > Subscriptions</li>
        <li>Look for "Original Transaction ID" or the subscription line item and note the date and product</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Billing issues or lapsed subscription</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Update your payment method: Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping</li>
        <li>If billing temporarily failed, Apple may place your subscription in a billing retry or grace period; once resolved, your access restores automatically</li>
        <li>If fully expired, tap "Restore Purchases" after fixing your payment method, or re-subscribe</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Cancel or change your plan</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage via App Store: App Store > Account > Subscriptions > AvatarForge AI</li>
        <li>Changes take effect immediately or at the next renewal depending on Apple's policies</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Family Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Family Sharing for auto-renewable subscriptions may not grant in-app entitlements for all family members. Our app links a subscription to a single in-app account. Each user should subscribe with their own in-app account if shared access isn't available</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. TestFlight vs App Store</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>TestFlight subscriptions and App Store subscriptions are separate environments. If you tested on TestFlight, you may need to install from the App Store and subscribe/restore there</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Still need help?</h2>
      <p>In the app, go to Settings > Help/Support and include: your app account email, Apple ID (do not send password), purchase date, and any receipt details (e.g., Original Transaction ID). We will investigate and guide you through next steps.</p>
