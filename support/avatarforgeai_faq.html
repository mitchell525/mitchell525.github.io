      <h2>Core Functionality</h2>
      
      <h3>What are credits and how do they work?</h3>
      <p>Credits are used to generate avatars - each generation costs 1 credit. New users receive 3 free one-time credits to get started. Subscribe to get monthly credits (25, 60, or 150 per month). When generating, subscription credits are used first, then one-time credits. Credits are refunded automatically if generation fails.</p>
      
      <h3>How long does generation take?</h3>
      <p>The generation process typically takes 30-60 seconds. You'll see a spinner while it generates. If it fails, you'll get your credit back automatically.</p>
      
      <h3>How do I export and share my images?</h3>
      <p>Tap on any image in your gallery to view it full-screen, then tap the export button to save to Photos, share via Messages/Mail, or copy to clipboard. All exports are high-quality.</p>

      <h2>AI and Generation Details</h2>
      
      <h3>How does generative AI work?</h3>
      <p>Our app uses 3rd party AI providers for image generation this includes Google's Gemini. These AI models create images from text descriptions. The AI has been trained on billions of images to understand visual concepts and relationships. Each generation is unique and created specifically based on your prompt, combining your description with the selected art style to produce a customized fantasy character.</p>
      
      <h3>How do prompts influence the generated images?</h3>
      <p>Prompts are instructions that guide the AI in creating your image. The more specific and descriptive your prompt, the better the AI can understand what you want. Details like hair color, clothing, equipment, and setting all influence the final result. The art style you select combines with your prompt to create the overall aesthetic of your character.</p>
      
      <h3>Are my prompts filtered or moderated?</h3>
      <p>Yes, all prompts are automatically reviewed for safety before generation. Our system removes or replaces inappropriate content with safe fantasy equivalents while preserving your core creative intent. This ensures all generated content is family-friendly and appropriate. The moderation process is automatic and happens instantly when you submit your prompt.</p>

      <h2>Technical Details</h2>
      
      <h3>How do images load in my gallery?</h3>
      <p>Thumbnails load first for quick browsing, then full-resolution images download on demand when you tap to view or export. This saves data and makes your gallery load faster.</p>
      
      <h3>How long are my images stored?</h3>
      <p>Your images are stored securely in the cloud. Images that haven't been accessed for 30 days are automatically deleted to manage storage costs and keep the service affordable.</p>
      
      <h3>What is the SynthID watermark?</h3>
      <p>SynthID is Google's invisible watermark technology that embeds imperceptible signals in AI-generated images. For images generated with Google's AI services this watermark helps identify content as AI-generated, promoting transparency in the AI industry. The watermark doesn't affect image quality or visibility - it's completely invisible to the human eye but detectable by specialized tools.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      
      <h3>What subscription plans are available?</h3>
      <p>We offer three plans: Basic (25 images/month), Plus (60 images/month), and Pro (150 images/month). Subscription credits reset each month. You can also keep your free one-time credits and use them when your monthly quota runs out.</p>
      
      <h3>How do subscriptions work with upgrades and downgrades?</h3>
      <p>Upgrades (cheaper to more expensive plans) take effect immediately - you're charged a prorated amount and get the higher tier benefits right away. Downgrades (more expensive to cheaper plans) take effect at your next renewal date - you keep your current plan benefits until then. You can see your current plan and any scheduled changes in the Store tab.</p>
      
      <h3>How do I manage or cancel my subscription?</h3>
      <p>To manage your subscription, go to Settings > Account Info, then tap 'Manage Subscription' to open Apple's subscription management. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription there. Changes take effect immediately for upgrades or at your next renewal for downgrades. Cancellations stop auto-renewal but you keep access until the current period ends.</p>

      <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>
      
      <h3>Will my generated images be unique?</h3>
      <p>While each generation is unique based on your specific prompt, AI doesn't guarantee complete uniqueness. Similar prompts may produce similar results, and the probabilistic nature of AI generation means there's always a chance of overlap with other users' creations. We don't check images against a database for uniqueness.</p>
      
      <h3>What about ethical use of AI-generated images?</h3>
      <p>We encourage responsible and respectful use of AI-generated images. Please respect intellectual property concepts and don't use images for deceptive purposes. When sharing publicly, consider attributing that the image was AI-generated. These images are intended for personal and creative use - enjoy creating your fantasy characters!</p>
